# Comparing Feature Extraction Approaches
There are conducted 4 experiments in total for this project: 
•	2 experiments for PCA with Classifier 1 and 2    
•	2 experiments for BACKWARD SEARCH (Feature Selection) with Classifier 1 and 2.
CLASSIFIERS USED:
CLASSIFIER 1: Linear Discrimant Analysis(LDA)
•	It is linear classification machine learning algorithm.
•	Library used to implement LDA was SK Learn using  “sklearn. discrimant_analysis”.
CLASSIFIER 2: Random Forest Classifier
•	Random Forest algorithm is based on decision Trees.
•	Library used to implement RFC was SK Learn using “sklearn. ensemble import random forest classifier”
